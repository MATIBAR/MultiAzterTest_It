 A DOG PALACE. 
 Some dogs live in a house with their families and some dogs live outside in the garden. Dog owners have often got doghouses -or kennels â€“in their gardens to protect their dogs from bad weather. Doghouses are usually about two metres long and one metre wide, with four walls and an opening, not a door. There isn't usually any furniture in a doghouse, but in California, USA, some dogs have got very special doghouses. They look like real houses with rooms, windows and furniture!.
