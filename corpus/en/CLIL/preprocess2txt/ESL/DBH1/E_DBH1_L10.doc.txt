3D school trip.
 What was your last school trip like?. Did your history teacher take you to Ancient Egypt to explore the pyramids? Did you travel down the Amazon River to find special plants for your biology class? .Of course not. Like most students around the world, you probably got on a bus and visited an art gallery. But if your school adopts 3D technology, your school trips will change forever. With the right equipment and a special computer program, your teachers will take you into space and back in time -and you won't need to leave the building. 
 If you type in the name of any country or tourist attraction on your laptop, you will find a virtual tour of that place. There's nothing new about that. But 3D technology goes much further than a virtual tour. 00 you remember the film Avatar? .In it, the main character had amazing adventures in a virtual world. 
 The virtual world seemed very real, and it was hard to believe it was imaginary. 30 school trips will be something like that. To go on them, students will put on special headpieces. If they look at the screens on the headpieces, they won't just see a place, they will feel like they are in it. According to some experts, this will be important for all types of education. They believe that students don't learn best from reading books or looking at a board. The Internet is an amazing tool, but downloading something online doesn't always help people lern. But if a student walks through the streets of Ancient Rome or travels through the inside of a human body, he or she will definitely remember it!.
 This technology will change education in other ways, too. Because the headpieces won't be expensive, schools in poor areas will buy them. The headpieces will help schools without enough teachers because the students using them will learn independently. Some people even predict that 30 headpieces will replace textbooks one day. Not bad!.
