A different type of Holiday. 
 Everyone enjoys going on holiday.lt's a time to relax and have fun with family and friends. However, some people are looking for more than just a relaxing holiday. They want to have fun but make a difference in the lifes of other people, too. Community Project Travel (CPT)  holidays help people do both. The CPT organisation takes volunteers to exotic places around the world and gives them important community projects to do. 
 For example, right now, CPT volunteers are working on projects in Nepal, Kenya and Australia. Some volunteers in Nepal are painting a new medical centre and a school. Others are making new furniture for these buildings. But it's not all work. The CPT programme combines work with travel. The organisation takes its volunteers on trips to the forests and villages in the area. In Kenya, the volunteers help local people to grow food. They are planting vegetables and fruit trees in the school gardens right now. Sometimes, they go on safari trips to the Rift alley and Lake Nakuru National Park to see the wild animals. In Australia, there are projects to plant trees in ares of deforestation, as well as opportunities to work with endangered animals. Many CPT projects help the environment. For example, CPT volunteers are working in Arnhem Land with the local Yolngu Aboriginal people. They are cleaning the beaches and helping turtles and other sea animals.
 CPT volunteers have a perfect holiday. They do important work for the environment and help to improve people's lives.They also see the world and visit fantastic places.
