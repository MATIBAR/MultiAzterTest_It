Bonobos.
 Animals aren´t as intelligent as humans, but some animals, like bonobos, are very c1ever. Bonobos are from the same family as chimpanzees and gorillas. Some people call them "pygmy chimpanzees", but they are different: They are smaller than chimpanzees and their legs are longer and thinner than chimpanzees’ legs. Bonobos aren't as aggressive as chimpanzees. They are very similar to according to some scientists, they are more intelligent than any other animal. 
 In what ways are bonobos similar to humans? Young bonobos stay with their mother for many years and she teaches them skills such as using rocks and sticks to get food. They also play some of the games of human children. It's very interesting to watch them play these games. In one game, a bonobo covers its eyes with its hands and runs around trying to catch its friends -just like human children do. Scientists sometimes teach Bonobos how to communicate with humans. 
 The most famous bonobo is probably Kanzi. Kanzi lives in a zoo in the US .He understands instructions in English and he communicates with people by pointing to word symbols on a chart. He knows more than 400 word symbols. Believe it or not, he can light a fire and cook simple meals. His son, Tico, also knows  many symbols and loves playing games on an iPad! 
 Sadly, there are only about 35,000 bonobos in the wild today because humans move into their habitat or kill them. Unfortunately, humans aren't always as nice as bonobos . We can learn so much from these clever animals.
