 MAKING A DIFFERENCE. 
 Peter Larson, from Minnesota, USA, finished high school in 2012. Like many other school students, he had a nice home and a very good life. He did sport every day, did homework, said goodnight to his parents and went to bed. But surprisingly, Peter didn't always sleep in a warm bed. For a few nights every winter, he went outside, climbed into a box and went to sleep in the cold. It's very cold in Minnesota -sometimes -10Â°C!. 
 So why did Peter do this? Some people haven't got homes and life is very difficult for them. Peter wanted people in his town to think about these homeless people and donate money to help them. "Most of us see them every day but never really realise their circumstances," he said. Peter started sleeping outside when he was six; At first, he slept outside at weekends in his family's garden. He increased this every year, until he slept outside for almost one month. Sometimes, in the morning, there was snow on the box and ice on his body! During the next 11 years, he spent about 300 nights in his box. His plan was very successful. Thousands of people heardl about Peter and they donated a total of more than $500,000 to help poor families. 
 Peter worked with a special organisation. For every $500 he gave the organisation, it helped one family find a home. This way, Peter helped hundreds of families. A few years later, Peter met some of the families he helped. He saw their new homes and spoke to the people living there. One woman started to cry -she was amazed her "angel" was so young. "I can't believe it," she said. "Peter helped me and my children and he was just a boy!" It seems one teenager really can make a difference!.
