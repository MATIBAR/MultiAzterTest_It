Marie Curie. 
 Marie Curie was born in Poland in 1867. She loved physics, and when she was 24, she went to study physics at the Sorbonne in Paris. She met Pierre Curie, a professor of physics, at the Sorbonne, and a year later, she married Pierre Curie. The Curies discovered the radioactive elements radium and polonium, and they did very important experiments with radium and polonium. After Pierre died in 1906, Marie became the head of the Physics Department. She discovered how radium and polonium can kill tumours. She received two Nobel Prizes for her work, but the Academy of Sciences refused to make Marie a member because she was a woman. Marie's experiments with radioactivity helped millions of people, but they were also dangerous. Marie died of leukemia when she was 67 years old.
