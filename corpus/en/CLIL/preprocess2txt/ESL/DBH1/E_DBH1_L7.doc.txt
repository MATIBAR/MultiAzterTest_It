Birthdays then and now.
 Birthday celebrations around the world are similar in many ways. Teenagers often celebrate with their friends at a fast-food restaurant with a birthday cake for dessert. Before everyone eats the birthday cake, they sing Happy Birthday. Well, I went to a very different kind of birthday party last week. It was at a swimming pool and it was great fun! We were jumping in and out of the pool all afternoon. Dave was making hot dogs. Janet was playing her guitar and some of my friends were dancing. It was a great party, but there wasn't a cake and we didn't sing Happy Birthday. We all got home very late. Most of us were still sleeping at midday on Sunday. 
 Birthdays weren't always such fun. The first birthday commemorations took place about 5,000 years ago. Before then there weren't any birthdays, because there wasn't a 365-day calendar. These early birthdays weren't happy events. People believed there was bad luck in the home on a birthday. To send the bad luck away, it was important for the house to be fuIl of family, friends, noise and music -that's how parties started. In Ancient Greece, people took round cakes to the temple on their birthdays for good luck. 
 Children's birthday celebrations became popular in the 1700s and right from the start there were birthday cakes. These are still a popular tradition and no children's birthday party is complete without one.
 So, when's your birthday? Have a happy one!.
