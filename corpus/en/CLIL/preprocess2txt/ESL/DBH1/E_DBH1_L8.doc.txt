My Favourite Celebration. 
 St Patrick's Day is a very  enjoyable day in the USA. It's traditional to wear green and eat green food on St Patrick's Day. In my family, we love going to really nice hamburger restaurant in our town to celebrate. On St Patrick's Day last year, we were eating hamburgers and listening to Irish music in our favourite restaurant when my sister came in with her friends. It was quite surprising -they were green all over!. Kate's face was green and so were her legs. We were shocked! My parents were not very happy with her. Anyway, we sat together and had ice cream and fizzy drinks. The green ice cream looked disgusting, but it wasn't at all bad!.
