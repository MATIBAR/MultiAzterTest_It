PARENTS DESIGN HOME WITH DISCO. 
 Are you going out tonight? Are your parents going to know where you are and what you're doing? Many parents don't want their teenagers to go out at night. They don't always know where they are, and some discos, arcades and meeting places can be dangerous for teenagers. Two British parents, Claire Farrow and lan Hogmth, decided to do something about this problem. They designed and built a house with a disco for their teenagers.
 The house is in London and it took 11 months to build. The 1 million pound house is very modern, with a shiny white kitchen and purple cupboards in the bedrooms. Claire and Ian wanted their house to be fun for their children and their children's friends. The disco has got coloured lights, a dance floor and a music system. Claire and Jan bought the dance floor while they were on holiday in China and the music system came from a disco in Birmingham.
 The teenagers love the disco. Gil, 16, is trying his skills as a disc jockey (DJ), and his sister, Tilly, 12, is going to invite friends to the disco after school. But the disco isn't only going to be for the teenagers. Claire and Jan are going to use it, too. 
 Claire doesn't like exercising at the gym and she thinks she's too old to go to a disco, so she and Ian are going to get their exercise by dancing in their private "club". They love dancing, and a dance teacher is coming the house on Wednesdays to give Claire and her friends lessons. What about the noise? Luckily, the disco is in the basement, so the loud music isn't going to disturb the neighbours.
 This unusual house has al so got a gym, a sauna and a cinema. Does this mean Gil and Tilly aren't 
 going to go out with friends any more?. 
 Probably not. Home entertainment is a good idea, but you can't keep teenagers at home all the time!.
