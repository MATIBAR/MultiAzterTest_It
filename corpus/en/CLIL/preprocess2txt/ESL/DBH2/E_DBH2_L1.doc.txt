All about sugar.
 From the moment we are born. We all  like the sweet taste of sugar. But what is sugar and is it good or bad for us? 
 What is sugar? Sugars are simple carbohydrates. The sugar you put in your cereal or chocolate milk in the morning is the most common type of sugar. We call it sucrose and it comes from sugar cane or sugar beets.
 How did the story of sugar begin?.
 For centuries people have known about the sweetness of sugar cane. At first, they chewed the cane to get out its juices. Later, they left the sugar cane to dry in the sun. 
 The juice dried and eventually formed hard, sweet rocks. The process of making table sugar began in India around 500 BC. In the beginning, poor people couldn't buy sugar because it was too expensive. But from the 1800s, the price went down and everybody wanted it.
 How much sugar is good for you?.
 The sugar you have every day shouldn't be more than 10 of your daily diet. That includes table sugar, sugar we add to food and drinks, and honey. Unfortunately, many of the things we love, such as chocolate, ice cream and cake, contain more sugar than is good for us. We must try to reduce these products in our daily diet. 
 When is sugar harmful?. 
 It's harmful when you have too much of it! Most experts agree that sugar in natural foods, like fruit and vegetables, is better for you than sugar we add to food. When we add sugar, we are taking in more calories and we might gain weight. Also, sugar isn't good for our teeth, and it can cause some serious illnesses. Sugar also doesn't allow us to concentrate well.
 What should you do?.
 You should read the information on food and drink labels, but you usually won't find the word sugar! Look for: corn syrup, fructose, dextrose and maltose. For health reasons, many people have to avoid eating things with these ingredients. But, everyone should try to eat healthier snacks like raw vegetables, yoghurt or fruit.
