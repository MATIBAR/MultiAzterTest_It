Animal world records.
 The fastest.
 The cheetah is the world's fastest animal on land. It can run up to 120 kilometres an hour. Cheetahs can also see very well, so they notice wild animals from far away. Most wild cheetahs live in Africa. There are only about 7,000 to 10,000 of these big cats left in the world because people are moving into their habitat.
 The longest.
 The reticulated python, from Asia, is the longest snake in the world. Experts believe it can grow up to 10 metres long, though the longest ever captured was 7.67 metres. These snakes live in tropical rainforests. They don't have to eat very often, but they can eat a whole deer at once. Reticulated pythons live for about 23 years in the wild.
 The smallest.
 The pygmy marmoset is the world's smallest monkey. It rarely grows more than 16 centimetres and it doesn't weigh more than 140 grams. These monkeys live in the Amazon rainforest, but people don't often see them. They live high in the trees, so that predators won't catch them.
 The cleverest.
 Most people think that birds aren't very intelligent, but some birds are actually very clever. Experts believe that crows are the cleverest of all the birds. In fact, a crow's brain is proportionately the size of a chimpanzee's. These birds can recognise  faces, solve problems and communicate with each other about dangerous places to avoid.
