Spotlight on teens. 
 Here are this month's entries about life in different countries.
 Kala:I live in Kochi in India. It's a big city by the sea. It's always hot and it often rains. The daytime temperature is over 30, and at night it doesn't go below 20. The monsoon rains begin in June. When rain floods the streets, we don't go to school. The boys and girls in my family don't study together. I attend a girls' school and my brother goes to a boys' school. I love dancing and I also play hockey. My brother plays rugby and cricket. Cricket is the favourite sport of all the men in our family and I told my father that I wanted to play, too. He said that he would teach me.
 Tina: I live in Sydney, Australia. Our summer is in December and January, so we celebrate Christmas in the middle of summer. Sydney is a beautiful, sunny city with many beaches. People here enjoy water sports. I swim and surf and love hanging out with my friends at the beach. My brother's got a boat and we go sailing at weekends. We went sailing last weekend and my brother said that he was going to take me on a dolphin-watching cruise around Nelson Bay the following week. Nelson Bay is famous for dolphin-watching. I can't wait!. Sailing is fun and I love dolphins.
 Billy:I'm from a small town in northern Canada. I go to a boarding School in the city of Edmonton. I stay at school all week and come home some weekends and for holidays.In winter, the temperature sometimes goes below 30 and it often snows. I drive my own snowmobile to get around. People here enjoy skiing and snowboarding in the winter. My favourite sport is ice hockey. In the summer holidays, July and August, my family usually goes camping, but my friend is staying with us this summer. She said that she preferred to stay in the city and go to the festivals and shows. The Edmonton Folk Festival starts next week. There will be four days of music and great food.
