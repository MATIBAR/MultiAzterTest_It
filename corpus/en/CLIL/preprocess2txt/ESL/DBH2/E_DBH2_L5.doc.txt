The Multi- Generational Family
 How many people are there in your family?
 We usually think a family means parents and their children. But there are other kinds of families, too. There are many places where grandparents, parents, children, aunts, uncles and cousins all live in one home. We call a family that has got three or more generations
 living together, a multi-generational family.
 You can find multi-generational families in many different parts of the world. Here are two examples.
 AFRICA.
 Can you imagine having 10, 20 or 30 mothers and fathers who all take care of you and your siblings?.There are some villages in Africa where this is actually quite common. For example, the Mbuti people of Zaire live in large groups. Each group is like one big family. The group hasn't got a leader. They discuss important decisions, and all the adults help to look after all the children. The children don't use the words aunt and uncle .They call all the women in the village mother and all the men father. What do you think the children in this multi-generational family call their cousins? That's right - brother and sister!. When the children grow up, they 25 mustn't choose a husband or wife from the same group. They bring someone from outside the group to join their family.
 INDIA.
 Think of eating dinner with 10 or more relatives every day of the week! This happens in many families in India. A man brings his wife to live in his parents' home. The man's brothers, their wives and children all live together in the family home. These large Indian families often live in houses where there is enough room for everyone. The men go to work, but the wives don't usually work outside the home. They stay at home to cook, clean and take care of the children and grandparents. The grandfather is the head of the family, so he's the person who makes all
 the important decisions. The grandmother makes all the decisions in the kitchen.
