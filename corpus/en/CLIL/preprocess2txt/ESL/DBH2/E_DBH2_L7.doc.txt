Tomorrowâ€™s world.
 Tasty food containers.
 What do you do with your empty crisp bag? Today we eat the crisps and throwaway the bag, but soon there will be crisp bags we can eat. The latest news in food is food containers you can eat.
 Most natural food has already got its own natural container. For example, apples and potatoes have got a peel, and eggs and nuts are in a shell. But now scientists are working on a synthetic peel or skin for things like yoghurt and chocolate. For these foods, they created a "WikiCell" skin. This is a biodegradable skin made of tiny molecules mixed with real food. According to scientists, these new
 food containers will be delicious and good for the environment.
 The strap Game.
 On the underground, passengers usually prefer sitting to standing up and holding onto the safety straps. But there's a good chance this will change. Scientists are working on a safety strap with its
 own computer game. Using only one hand, you can hold onto the strap and play the game at the same time. There won't be any danger of missing your stop because the game will alert you when
 to get off the train. It sounds like journeys are going to become a lot more fun.
 Electronic clothing.
 Recently, scientists created clothes made from a new hi- tech material. This material can transform the differences in your body heat into electricity. Just imagine - you can use your shirt or trousers to recharge your mobile phone or your MP4! This isn't science fiction; electric clothes will be in the shops in about two years.
