Earth day.
 The first Earth Day was on 22nd April, 1970. There were rallies, seminars and events all over the United States, and over 20 million people participated. Before Earth Day, there weren't
 many laws to protect the environment. Factories polluted the air and water. People cut down forests and didn't think about the animals or plants living there. No one talked about saving energy or recycling. 
 Earth Day changed the way we think about the Earth and its resources. It taught us to be more conscious of our environment. People began to recycle newspapers and paper as well as glass, aluminium and plastic. We also learned to be more careful about the quantity of petrol. electricity and water we use.
 In 2012, more than one billion people all over the world participated in Earth Day events. The world is a much cleaner place than it was 40 years ago, but there's still a lot of work to do.
