Hi there! In Wales, lots of people are bilingual. I speak English at home. At school, I speak Welsh, and I'm learning French, too. Here's an article from our school magazine. Two people talk about the languages they're learning.
 There are more than 6,000 different languages in the world. Some of these languages have similar vocabulary and grammar, but many are completely different. 
 For example: 
 Some languages give nouns a gender. The nouns can be masculine, feminine or neutral. Other languages don't give nouns a gender. 
 Some languages use the letters of an alphabet to write words. Other languages use characters instead of words. 
 Some languages don't conjugate verbs. Other languages have many different conjugations.

 Harry. I'm learning Japanese because my brother lives in Japan. Some aspects of Japanese are easy. For example, there aren't any verb conjugations, and nouns don't have a gender. But reading and writing in Japanese is very difficult for me. There are thousands of different characters to learn. And when you read a sentence, you don't read it from left to right. You read it from top to bottom. Vanessa.
 I'm English, but I live in Wales. I'm learning Welsh because I want to speak to my Welsh friends in Welsh. In English, nouns don't have a gender, so it's difficult for me to remember the gender of nouns in Welsh. And spelling Welsh words isn't easy. But I love speaking the Welsh language, and I'm very happy with my progress.
