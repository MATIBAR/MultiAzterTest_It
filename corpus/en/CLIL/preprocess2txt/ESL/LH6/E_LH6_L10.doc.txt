Liverpool is a city in the north west of England. I was there last August. Here are two places I can recommend. The Echo Wheel is a very popular tourist attraction in Liverpool. It's 60 metres tall. I recommend the wheel because you can see incredible views of t he city. From the top of the wheel you can see   parks, museums and galleries. You can see the river Mersey. On a clear day, you can see the mountains in Wales. The wheel turns 3600 and the ride lasts about 15 minutes .Check online for ticket prices and opening times. The wheel has got wheelchair access. Sefton Park is one of Liverpool’s largest green areas. I recommend the park because it’s the perfect place for a quiet walk or a bike ride. There are statues and fountains in the park. There is a lake where you can play tennis, football and other sports. If you want to take your laptop, there are cafes with wifi zones. The park is open 24 hours a day and it’s free to go in.
