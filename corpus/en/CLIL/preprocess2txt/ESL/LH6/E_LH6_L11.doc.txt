What do we know about Edward Jenner? 
 We know that Edward Jenner was a brilliant doctor and scientist. He developed a treatment to protect patients from small pox. He saved the lives of many people. But where did he live? What did he do in his free time? Did he have a family? When did he die? Edward Jenner lived from 1749 to 1823. He lived with his wife and three children in a small village in England called Berkeley. He often treated people at his home, but he didn't take any money from poor people. 
 Jenner had many hobbies. He was very interested in wildlife. In his free time, he liked watching birds and hedgehogs. Jenner was also interested in hot air balloons, because they were a very new invention. In 1784, more than 100 years before the invention of the plane, Jenner travelled nearly 40 kilometres in a balloon. Today, Edward Jenner's home is a museum about his life and his interests.
