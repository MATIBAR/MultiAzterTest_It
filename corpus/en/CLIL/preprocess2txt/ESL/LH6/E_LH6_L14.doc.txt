Children and teenagers in action.
 All around the world, children and teenagers are helping to make their communities better places. They give up their free time to help neighbours and charity organisations. Their actions improve many people's lives.
 Help an elderly neighbour.
 This is Gemma. She lives with her family in Michigan in the USA. Their neighbour, Molly, is 86 years old. Gemma visits Molly every day and offers help. She sweeps her garden path and waters her plants. And she talks to Molly about her life at school.
 Clean up the countryside.
 Nick and his friends help to clean up the countryside in the UK. They meet at the weekend once a month. They go to rivers, beaches, parks and forests to pick up all the litter they can find. Sometimes they have competitions to see who can find the most litter.
 Walk dogs. 
 Leroy and his younger sister are volunteer dog walkers. Every weekend they go to a charity for abandoned dogs in Dublin. They take the dogs for walks in the park or in the countryside. They also help to train the dogs. 
 Visit a retirement home.
 Lisa's favourite subject is ICT. She's good with computers. So, once a week she visits a retirement home,in Wellington. She teaches the pensioners how to send emails and how to use a social network. With Lisa's help, some of the pensioners are writing blogs.
