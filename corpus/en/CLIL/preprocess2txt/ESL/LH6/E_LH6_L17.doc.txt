What I'm going to do.
  I'm going to go away for the weekend with my mum. This is what we're going to do. Do you like our plans? 
 Next weekend, I'm going to go to Edinburgh with my mother. We're going to take the train from Manchester on Friday after school. It leaves at quarter to five. It arrives in Edinburgh at half past eight. The journey takes nearly four hours, so we're going to take books to read on the train. And we're going to take sandwiches and drinks.
 In Edinburgh, we're going to stay with my aunt, my mother's sister. We're going to visit Edinburgh castle on Saturday morning. After that, we're going to go shopping in the city centre. I want to buy some earrings. In the evening, we're going to see a play at the theatre. 
 On Sunday we're going to walk in the botanical garden before lunch. Then, in the afternoon, we're going to catch the train back to Manchester. 
 The weather forecast says that it's going to be cloudy but it isn't going to rain . I think we're going to have a fantastic weekend!
