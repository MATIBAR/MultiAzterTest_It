Thanksgiving day.A day to give thanks.
 The second Monday of October is Thanksgiving Day in many parts of Canada. People don't work. Children don't go to school. 
 Traditionally, the holiday was to celebrate and give thanks for the harvest. Nowadays, many people simply celebrate and give thanks for everything that is good in life. For example, good health, good friends and good fortune.
 Thanksgiving is a time when families meet and have dinner together. The meal usually includes roast turkey, lots of vegetables and a spicy pumpkin pie, which is delicious. 
 Many Canadians also enjoy watching American football on Thanksgiving Day. There is always a special match on television. The match is called The Thanksgiving Day Classic.
