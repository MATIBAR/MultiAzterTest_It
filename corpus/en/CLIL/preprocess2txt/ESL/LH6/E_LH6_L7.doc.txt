Generous trees.
 Trees give us so many things. They give us fruit, chocolate and coconuts to eat and coffe to drink. They give us wood to make houses and furniture. And did you know that natural rubber comes from a tree too? Here are some more things that come from trees.
 Oxygen.
 There is one thing that all trees give us. You can't see it, but it's all around us. It's in the air. It's oxygen. In a process called photosynthesis, trees absorb carbon dioxide and turn into oxygen.
 Medicines.
 Man types of medicine come from trees. Aspirin, for example. Aspirin is a natural product that comes from the bark of willow trees. In the 18th century, people used willow bark to make a type of tea. The tea helped people who were in pain. Nowadays , aspirin is made in laboratories.
 Cork.
  Have you got a cork noticeboard at school? Where does the cork come from? It comes from the bark of a special type of oak tree. The tree grows in Spain, Portugal and France. People take the bark off the trees. This process does not harm the tree. The bark grows back every 7 to 10 years.
 Paper.
 The main ingredient of paper is wood  fibres. Factories mix wood fibres with water and chemicals to make paper. But factories can also make new paper from old magazines and newspapers. Itâ€™s important to recycle paper because it saves trees.
 Chewing gum.
 Natural chewing gum is made from a thick liquid that comes from the sapodilla tree. People cut the tree and collect the liquid in buckets. To make natural chewing gum, they add flavouring and sugar to the liquid.
