SATNAV.
 Iâ€™,m a taxi driver in Dublin. I've got satnav in the taxi. I use it to find addresses in the city. It also tells me if there are any traffic problems. Satnav technology makes my Job a lot easier. 
 APPS and smartphones.
 I'm learning French. I haven't got much time to practise. But now I'm learning words and expressions with an app on my smartphone. It's great because I can use it anywhere in the city. 
 Tablets.
 We use a tablet to go online. We look up the opening times of shops and museums. We also find out what's on at the cinema and what time the films start. It's easier, cheaper and quicker than a phone call. 
 Online shopping.
 I love online shopping. I send my shopping list to the supermarket and they deliver everything to my house. It's so easy and it saves me lots of time. 
 WIFI ZONES & LAPTOPS.
  I'm lucky. I've got a small laptop. I use it to send emails and to chat to my friends. I can now do those things in the city centre because there are lots of places with free wifi zones: cafes, the library, parks, etc. I like using my laptop in the park I can do my homework and get fresh air at the same time! 
 Can you imagine your life without technology?
